# Description
This is an application designed for management teams to input Manager and Employee information. Identifying their position and other useful information. A webpage is generated from user terminal inputs. The creation of this page helped me learn about Object Oriented Programming and testing with Jest. I wrote test files to make sure everything operates correctly and used Inquirer for the command line prompts

# Installation
Inquirer and Jest is required to run this application

# Usage
To use this application type 'node index.js' into the command line, then follow the prompts until you have filled out all the information needed, then open the dist folder and HTML will be generated for you displaying your team and all your info.
